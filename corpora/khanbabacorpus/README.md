# Part-of-Speech tagged corpus (Khan Baba Corpus)
Natural language processing deals with making computers to understand natural language. 
This can be done in two ways: rationalist approach; where language behavior is formulated 
in rules and these rules are then implemented in computers through programming, empiricist approach; 
automatically learn language behavior from large corpora. Most of the languages are enriched by building such corpora. 
One of these corpora is a Part-Of-Speech (POS) Corpus, which is annotated with POS tags. 
This project is funded by German Federal Foreign Office and supported by Technical University of Berlin, ZiiK, and Nangarhar
University to build a small-scale part-of-speech tagged corpus for the Pashto language, which can be used for research purposes
in Pashto language processing at Nangarhar University.

## Project Description
This project will be accomplished with a duration of four months. A team of few members will contribute to the development of
the corpus. The project manager; responsible for managing and leading the team and also allocating resources throughout the project. Pashto linguist; who will help in designing of POS tagset and also correct and evaluating the tagged corpus.
Taggers, who will collect and tag the text.

## Contributors
### Pashto Linguist
A person having knowledge of Pashto linguistics (grammar) as well as English linguistics.  He will be responsible for:
  1. Designing and establishing a tag-set for morphological categories (e.g. noun, adjectives, verbs, prepositions etc.) based
on the book of [Descriptive Grammar of Pashto (David, 2014)](https://books.google.com.af/books/about/Descriptive_Grammar_of_Pashto_and_its_Di.html?id=wS7nBQAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y).
  1. Decide the number of tags based on the depth of the grammatical classes to be covered (providing distinct codings for
                                                                                                      all classes of words having distinct grammatical behavior).
  1. Provide description and reasons for selecting given tag-set.
  1. Educate taggers about Pashto morphology.
  1. Evaluate and correct the text tagged with the wrong label.

### POS Taggers
Persons collecting and tagging Pashto text. Have experience in text editing, online textual resources usage, GitHub usage, 
computer programming skill, and some natural language processing knowledge. They will be responsible for:
  1. Collecting Pashto articles text from online newswires (e.g. [Deutsche Welle (DW)](http://www.dw.com/ps/دويچه-ويله-پښتو/s-11722)
, [Voice of America (VOA)](http://www.pashtovoa.com), and [British Broadcasting Corporation Pashto (BBC)](http://www.bbc.com/pashto) etc).
  1. Document each article domain and source.
  1. Annotate collected text with predefined POS tagset.
  1. Submit each annotated and raw text article to specified GitHub repository.
  1. Show his daily contribution by committing his progressed work into given GitHub repository.
